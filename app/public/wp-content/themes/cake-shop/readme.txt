== Description ==

The Cake Shop WordPress theme is WooCommerce-ready and fully responsive. This is a modern theme with many options that allow you to change the layouts and designs of any type of page. You can change the layouts of blog pages, search pages, single posts, and single pages.

WordPress Cake Shop theme includes built-in banners, a call to action section, and a latest posts section for a custom homepage. You just need to enable the custom homepage option and you will see a completely different homepage instead of the standard home page with only the latest posts section. With the premium version, you can find even more customizable homepage sections. Moreover, the premium version includes 4 additional banner themes with beautiful designs. All sections of the custom homepage are fully customizable, so you can change the colors of elements, text, images, number of posts or products displayed on the homepage, background colors, etc.

WordPress Cake Shop theme has a beautifully designed and customizable blog page. You can change the entire design of your blog page, from the background color of the post block to the font settings. By the way, it's worth noting that the blog and search page layouts can be customized separately, so if you need to show the sidebar on the blog page and hide it on the search page, you can easily do this from the settings page.

As we already mentioned, the Cake Shop theme is integrated with WooCommerce and there are many options to control the design of WooCommerce pages. You can customize the WooCommerce primary button settings, font sizes, text and link colors, layouts, and more. WooCommerce settings can be controlled separately from single page/post settings (blog and search page). This means that WooCommerce pages can have a completely different style than other pages on the website.

Cake Shop also adds some WooCommerce capabilities. For example, you can add a unique search bar for your store pages directly from our theme settings. It will add a list of store categories on the left and a product-only search field on the right. Additionally, you can add different store sections to your custom homepage.
